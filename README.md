# Spock Framework Example Project

The purpose of this project is to help you get started with Spock. The project includes several example specifications and a build script with Gradle. It also makes it easy to create an Eclipse or IDEA project, allowing you to run the example specs from within your IDE.
Gradle will automatically download all required dependencies, compile the project, and finally run the example specs. Gradle bootstraps itself, alleviating the need to have a build tool preinstalled.

## Building with Gradle
Type: ./gradlew clean test

Downloaded files (including the Gradle distribution itself) will be stored in the Gradle user home directory (typically "<user_home>/.gradle").

## Creating an IDEA project
Type: ./gradlew cleanIdea idea

Open the generated project in IDEA. You should now be able to build the project, and to run the specs like you would run a JUnit test.

## Getting hold of the Jars used in this project
Type: ./gradlew collectJars

The Jars will be copied to build/output/lib. The comments in build.gradle explain what they are needed for.
